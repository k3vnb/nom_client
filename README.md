## About

NomsPDX is a voting app where users upvote their favorite burger/gyro/coffee, et al. It is designed to foster a positive community and ease of use. Users can nominate new restaurants for best in category, and add comments to restaurants they upvote. New users searching for, for example, the Best Burger in Portland will find this app to be an up-to-date, dynamic, reliably crowd-sourced resource. While this iteration focuses on the PDX metro area, a future version of this app will support multiple locales.

## Tech Stack

This app utilizes the PERN stack (Postgres - Express - React - Node).  
The server repo is located at https://www.github.com/lemurriot/noms-server.  
It utilizes elements from Material-UI, authentication with Google OAuth2.0, and Google Places API.
The client is hosted on now.sh, and the server is hosted on Heroku.
